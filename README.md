### ***NumPy Pandas Exercise***

*This notebook is a hands-on project, completed by me in COURSERA. This notebook covers the basic operations of the two important python libraries known as NumPy and Pandas. NumPy and Pandas are two of the most widely used python libraries in Data Science. They offer high-performance, easy-to-use structures and data analysis tools.*
